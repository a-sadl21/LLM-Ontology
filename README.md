üß† LLM Ontology (LLMOnto)

Welcome to the LLM Ontology (LLMOnto) project! This repository contains an ontology that structures key concepts related to Large Language Models (LLMs), providing a basic understanding of how LLMs are built, trained, and applied in real-world scenarios.

üìö Project Overview

This project was developed as part of our Masters programme at the University of Lorraine. The main goal is to offer a resource for students to understand LLMs without diving into overly technical details. The ontology organises concepts such as:

LLM architectures and components
Training methods and datasets
Application domains for NLP tasks

üîç Contents

Ontology File (LLMOnto.rdf): The OWL file representing the LLM ontology.
Documentation (LLMOntodoc/): Auto-generated HTML documentation for browsing the ontology structure and relationships.
Final Report (Ontologies Project Report.pdf): Detailed report explaining the development process, design decisions, and competency questions guiding the ontology.

‚ú® Key Features

Modular Structure: Reuses existing ontologies (e.g., SWeMLS, FOAF) where appropriate.
Rich Semantic Relationships: Defines classes, data properties, and object properties for detailed LLM representation.
Educational Focus: Designed to support learning and knowledge-sharing in the field of NLP.

üöÄ Getting Started

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LLM-Ontology.git

Exploring the Ontology:
Open LLMOnto.rdf in Prot√©g√© for an interactive exploration.
Browse the documentation by opening LLMOntodoc/index.html in your web browser.

üìÑ Documentation

The documentation includes detailed descriptions of the ontology‚Äôs classes, properties, and relationships. You can view it by navigating to the /LLMOntodoc/ folder and opening index.html, or by downloading the PDF version.
